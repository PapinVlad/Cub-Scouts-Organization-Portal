### Obanshire Cubs Frontend

Frontend application for the Obanshire Cub Scouts website.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16.x or higher recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)


## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:

```shellscript
git clone [repository-url]
cd obanshire-cubs-frontend
```


2. Install dependencies:

```shellscript
npm install
# or if you use Yarn
yarn install
```




## Running the Application

### Development Mode

To start the development server:

```shellscript
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

This will run the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will automatically reload when you make changes to the code. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Production Build

To create a production build:

```shellscript
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

This builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include hashes for cache management.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- `npm start` - Runs the app in development mode
- `npm run build` - Builds the app for production
- `npm test` - Launches the test runner
- `npm run eject` - Ejects from create-react-app configuration (⚠️ one-way operation)

## Environment Setup

The application expects a backend API to be running. By default, it will connect to the API at `http://localhost:5000` .

You may need to create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```plaintext
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```

## Connecting to the Backend

Make sure the backend server is running before starting the frontend application. The frontend will make API calls to the backend server for data.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Make sure all dependencies are installed correctly
2. Check if the backend server is running
3. Verify your `.env` file has the correct API URL
4. Clear your browser cache or try in incognito mode
5. Check the console for any error messages
